1) Use physical dimensions judged without bias. Be mindful of perceptual illusions.


# Graph Guidelines
2) Consider the task: Know the intention of the graph and what information you want to communicate.


# Graph Guidelines
3) Minimize the number of mental operations: Reduces mental workload and error in judgment.


# Graph Guidelines
4) Keep the data-ink ratio high: Minimize the amount of ink that does not depict actual data points or the relation between those points. Eliminate clutter.


# Graph Guidelines
5) Code multiple graphs consistently: Allow the reader to relate multiple graphs together so it can paint a larger picture.
